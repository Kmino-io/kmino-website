# Getting Started with Astro

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

> **Note:** You must have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed globally to use the commands below.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `pnpm astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

# üìñ Publishing New Articles

This guide explains how to add new posts and authors to our Blog.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Inside `src/content` you‚Äôll find two key folders:

```
src/content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authors/   ‚Üê Author information (JSON)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blog/      ‚Üê Blog posts (Markdown)
```

---

## üë§ Adding an Author

1. Navigate to **`src/content/authors`**.
2. Create a new JSON file named after the author, e.g. `lucas.json`.
3. Follow this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Lucas Souza",
  "image": {
    "url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29847191?v=4",
    "alt": "Lucas Souza's avatar"
  },
  "jobDescription": "Web Developer",
  "socials": [
    {
      "title": "GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/LucasCodr",
      "icon": "ri:github-fill"
    },
    {
      "title": "LinkedIn",
      "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-souza-11547414a/",
      "icon": "ri:linkedin-box-fill"
    }
  ]
}
```

### üîó About `socials`

- **`title`** ‚Üí Label of the social media platform.
- **`url`** ‚Üí Link to the profile.
- **`icon`** ‚Üí Name of the desired icon from [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/ri/?keyword=Ri).
- If you need another social media icon, just search for it there and copy its name.

This structure ensures you only define author info once, instead of repeating it in every blog post.
