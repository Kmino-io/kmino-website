# Define Your MVP Scope: A Practical Worksheet

Most ideas start too broad. A good MVP is a 4–6 week slice that proves core value with real users—no more, no less. Use this worksheet to turn a big vision into a focused, buildable scope. It’s the same approach we use in our MVP‑in‑a‑Box engagements (4 weeks for web, 6 for Web3).

## What is an MVP (for this exercise)?

The smallest product that lets a single primary user complete one end‑to‑end job, produces learnings you can act on, and is safe to evolve.

## 1) One‑line value proposition

Template: For [target user] who [pain], [product] helps them [job/outcome] so they can [business result].

Example: For marketplace sellers who lose time reconciling orders, LedgerLite lets them auto‑sync payouts so they get accurate books in minutes.

## 2) Primary user and top 3 jobs

- Who is the primary user persona?
- What are the top three jobs they must achieve? (verbs!)
- Which single job will we validate first? (pick one)

## 3) Happy‑path storyboard (≤7 steps)

List the exact clicks/screens from first touch to outcome. If it’s more than seven steps, you’re probably over‑scoping.

## 4) Must‑have vs later (MoSCoW)

- Must: absolutely required to complete the happy path.
- Should: improves trust or speed; can ship in week 3–4.
- Could: nice‑to‑have; backlog for v1.1.
- Won’t (now): explicitly out of scope; prevents scope creep.

## 5) Success metrics (v1)

- Activation: % of sign‑ups who complete the happy path.
- Time‑to‑value: minutes from first action to outcome.
- Qualitative: top 3 quotes from 5 pilot users.

## 6) Non‑goals and constraints

- Non‑goals: what we will not attempt in v1.
- Constraints: compliance, budgets, platforms, chains, devices, languages.
- Guardrails: performance floor, security basics, reliability SLO (simple!).

## 7) Integrations plan

Choose the lightest option that proves value:

- Zero‑integration mock (fake data) for usability tests.
- Thin adapter to 1 provider with an error fallback.
- Full integration only if the happy path depends on it.

## 8) Acceptance criteria (write 3)

Use simple Given/When/Then for your chosen happy path and two edge cases. Keep each to two lines max.

## 9) Risks and cheapest tests

- Biggest assumption about users? Test with a Figma prototype first.
- Biggest technical unknown? Spike behind a feature flag or mock.
- Biggest go‑to‑market risk? Pre‑sell or run a concierge pilot.

## 10) Fit to a fixed package

- Web MVP‑in‑a‑Box($10k)*: 4 weeks, includes a 2‑hour requirements workshop, clickable Figma, core web app, deployment,documentation, and one in‑scope feedback iteration.
- Web3 MVP‑in‑a‑Box($15k)*: 6 weeks, adds a smart contract + dApp front‑end, wallet integration, deployment to your chosen EVM chain.

*Current prices as of September 2025. Prices may increase on Q4 2025. 

Out of scope for v1: ongoing feature work, heavy branding/marketing sites, complex custom integrations, native mobile apps, multi‑chain beyond the core.

## How to use this worksheet

Block 60–90 minutes. Fill it with your team. If your happy path doesn’t fit on one page, cut scope until it does. Bring this to our free call—we’ll pressure‑test it and turn it into a concrete 4–6 week plan.
