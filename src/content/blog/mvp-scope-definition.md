# Define Your MVP Scope: A Practical Worksheet

Most ideas start too broad. A good MVP is a 4–6 week slice that proves core value with real users—no more, no less. Use this worksheet to turn a big vision into a focused, buildable scope. It’s the same approach we use in our MVP‑in‑a‑Box engagements (4 weeks for web, 6 for Web3).

## What is an MVP (for this exercise)?

The smallest product that lets a single primary user complete one end‑to‑end job, produces learnings you can act on, and is safe to evolve.

## 1) One‑line value proposition

 - Template: For [**target user**] who [**pain**], [**product**] helps them [**job/outcome**] so they can [**business result**].

WHY: A sharp statement kills features that don’t serve the core promise and makes trade‑offs easy.

Example (Meetly – lightweight meeting scheduler): For solo consultants who waste time scheduling meetings, Meetly lets clients book available slots so they cut back‑and‑forth emails and start sooner.

## 2) Primary user and top 3 jobs

- Who is the primary user persona?
- What are the top three jobs they must achieve? (verbs!)
- Which single job will we validate first? (pick one)

WHY: Picking a single job avoids “kitchen‑sink” scopes and accelerates useful feedback.

Example (Meetly):
- Persona: Solo consultant
- Top jobs: set availability; share booking link; confirm bookings
- Chosen job: client books a slot via a link

## 3) Happy‑path storyboard (≤7 steps)

- Define ≤7 steps from first touch to outcome. If it’s more than seven, you’re probably over‑scoping.

WHY: A short storyboard exposes unnecessary steps and highlights the minimum UI you must build.

Example (Meetly):
1. Sign up and verify email
2. Define weekly availability (days, hours)
3. Create a booking link
4. Share link with a client
5. Client selects a time
6. Both see a confirmation page
7. Optional: download .ics file

## 4) Must‑have vs later (MoSCoW)

- Must: absolutely required to complete the happy path.
- Should: improves trust or speed; can ship in week 3–4.
- Could: nice‑to‑have; backlog for v1.1.
- Won’t (now): explicitly out of scope; prevents scope creep.

WHY: MoSCoW creates a shared language to keep v1 focused without losing sight of the future.

Example (Meetly):
- Must: create booking link; define availability; view bookings
- Should: email confirmations; basic timezone support
- Could: Google Calendar sync; reminders; custom branding
- Won’t: payments; team accounts; advanced roles/permissions

## 5) Success metrics (v1)

- Activation: % of sign‑ups who complete the happy path.
- Time‑to‑value: minutes from first action to outcome.
- Qualitative: top 3 quotes from 5 pilot users.

WHY: Clear week‑4 targets make it obvious if the MVP is working and what to change next.

Example (Meetly):
- Activation: 40% of new users create a link and get ≥1 booking
- Time‑to‑value: ≤15 minutes from signup to first booking
- Qualitative: “I scheduled my first client in minutes”

## 6) Non‑goals and constraints

- Non‑goals: what we will not attempt in v1.
- Constraints: compliance, budgets, platforms, chains, devices, languages.
- Guardrails: performance floor, security basics, reliability (simple!).

WHY: Non‑goals prevent scope creep; constraints avoid late surprises.

Example (Meetly):
- Non‑goals: payments, multi‑user orgs, deep calendar sync
- Constraints: web‑only; budget 4 weeks; GDPR‑friendly data handling
- Guardrails: p95 page load <1.5s; basic auth; 99.5% uptime target

## 7) Integrations plan

- Choose the lightest option that proves value:

- Zero‑integration mock (fake data) for usability tests.
- Thin adapter to 1 provider with an error fallback.
- Full integration only if the happy path depends on it.

WHY: Heavy integrations slow learning and add fragile dependencies too early.

Example (Meetly):
- Start: no external calendar; offer .ics download
- Next: thin Google Calendar adapter for confirmed bookings
- Later: real‑time availability sync

## 8) Acceptance criteria (write 3)

 - Use simple Given/When/Then for your chosen happy path and two edge cases. Keep each to two lines max.

WHY: Clear acceptance tests speed development and review.

Example (Meetly):
- Given a user with set availability, when a client selects a slot, then the booking appears in the user’s dashboard.
- Given a slot was booked, when another client clicks it, then they see an unavailable message.
- Given a booking exists, when the user cancels it, then the client sees a cancellation notice.

## 9) Risks and cheapest tests

- Biggest assumption about users? Test with a Figma prototype first.
- Biggest technical unknown? Spike behind a feature flag or mock.
- Biggest go‑to‑market(GTM) risk? Pre‑sell or run a concierge pilot.

WHY: Fast, cheap tests protect the timeline and reveal direction before you overbuild.

Example (Meetly):
- User assumption: clients will self‑serve; test with a fake booking page and 5 users
- Technical unknown: timezone handling; spike with a popular library
- GTM risk: traffic acquisition; pre‑sell via a landing page + ads budget

## 10) Fit to a fixed package

- Web MVP‑in‑a‑Box($10k)*: 4 weeks, includes a 2‑hour requirements workshop, clickable Figma, core web app, deployment,documentation, and one in‑scope feedback iteration.
- Web3 MVP‑in‑a‑Box($15k)*: 6 weeks, adds a smart contract + dApp front‑end, wallet integration, deployment to your chosen EVM chain.

*Current prices as of September 2025. Prices may increase on Q4 2025. 

Out of scope for v1: ongoing feature work, heavy branding/marketing sites, complex custom integrations, native mobile apps, multi‑chain beyond the core.
