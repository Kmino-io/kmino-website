# Why Great Teams Still Outsource, And How They Do It Right

Outsourcing is one of those topics that always sparks debate. Some teams see it as a smart way to build and scale quickly, while others view it as a shortcut that weakens culture and ownership. The truth sits somewhere in the middle. Outsourcing can be incredibly effective when used strategically and intentionally, but it can also create setbacks if done for the wrong reasons.

When done right, outsourcing helps teams stay focused on their strengths while trusted experts handle the rest. When done poorly, it becomes a constant cycle of rework, friction, and lost momentum. The key is knowing when it fits your stage and goals.

I've been on both sides of the coin. I have worked in three separate development outsourcing companies, and I also was in the shoes of someone trying to foster a strong company culture with new engineer hires. Additionally, I've also worked with the *wrong* outsourcing companies: disorganized teams, lack of ownership, poor communication, change in leadership, cheap prices but awful results. 

All that said, today we'll explore a few situations where outsourcing is a good option.

# When Not to Outsource

I may put myself on the hot seat here with my cofounders, but the truth is not every company should outsource development work.

If you're a technical founder or already have a team with founding engineers with a clear product vision and hands-on ability to build fast, outsourcing can add unnecessary layers between you and your users. The same applies to organizations with strong, established development cultures and nothing beyond your expertise to build. If you know what to do, how to hire, and how to ship it, it's better to keep it in-house.

When your engineering, design, and product teams already operate in sync, they know each other's heartbeats, as Tony Fadell describes in the amazing [Build](https://a.co/d/emSQXUL). 

In this scenario, it's often better to keep that rhythm intact. The pace of development, feedback, and iteration is already aligned with the rest of your company and with the market.

Still, even teams with a strong internal rhythm can hit moments where outside help is the smarter move. Whether it's about speed, focus, or deep technical specialization, outsourcing can unlock new capacity without disturbing your core, as long as it's done right, and with the right technology partner.

# When to Outsource

There are three more common cases where outsourcing technology work is the right move. With the right partner, outsourcing can, respectively: *enable your growth*, *protect your team*, and *strengthen your core*.

## #1 Early Startups: Build Without Hiring Headaches

You've just secured funding, the clock is ticking, and you need a product in customers' hands as soon as possible. The problem is, you don't yet have a dev or design team. Recruiting takes months, and every week of delay can slow momentum and investor confidence. You aren't technical, nor have a technical founder or founding engineer by your side. You have a great vision, the future may be bright, but you're stuck behind technicalities.

This is the most common case of outsourcing. And with the right partner, it becomes a **growth enabler instead of a compromise**. If you find the right team, you can go from [idea to MVP quickly](https://www.kmino.io/blog/from-idea-to-mvp), start getting user feedback, iterate on the product, and make your original vision a reality. The right team will help you define priorities, validate assumptions, and build efficiently, so you can stay focused on fundraising, sales, and customer conversations.

Later down the line, with a product on the market, you can decide which way to go: keeping the technology partner onboard, or hiring in-house. Whatever you decide to do, you can do it once the time is right.

## #2 Big Companies: Temporary Projects, Zero HR Baggage

Hiring for tech is costly. Tech recruiters, tech interviewers, weeks of hiring process, and rounds of team interviews. Some companies can afford that, but it doesn't make sense to go down this path always. If you have a temporary 3-month project to put out there, and no internal team to allocate to it, why bother?

That's the second case where having a good technology partner makes sense.

Even large organizations with mature engineering teams face temporary surges in workload. Maybe you need to rebuild an internal tool, develop a proof of concept, or ship a project that doesn't justify hiring full-time staff.

Bringing in a specialized partner for these short-term initiatives helps you move fast without expanding headcount or navigating lengthy onboarding. Once the project is complete, you can wrap up cleanly, with quality work delivered and no long-term commitments.

For big teams, outsourcing in this way **protects your core developers** from context-switching and keeps them focused on the roadmap that matters most.

## #3 Established Teams: Solving Deep Tech Gaps

Even the best teams have limits to their expertise.

Maybe your developers are great at building features but less experienced with scaling infrastructure or managing data pipelines. Maybe your data scientists need help with automation or integrating AI into production environments. In these cases, outsourcing specific technical areas can amplify your team's capabilities without disrupting their workflow.

The ideal external team integrates seamlessly into your existing setup, complements your strengths, and **leaves your systems stronger than before**. No silos nor mystery handoffs: just targeted expertise when and where you need it.

I once worked as a PM on an outsourced development team for a company valued in the billions of dollars. You read it right, with a 'b'. 

They had an internal network team that knew *everything* there was to know about network: components, routers, protocols, security, you name it. However, on this network team, they lacked DevOps and automation expertise. They absolutely had this knowledge elsewhere in the company. But with every team stretched thin, other priorities, and so on, they decided to outsource.

We helped them build tools to automate network management across different buildings all across the globe. Once that was done, we parted ways; they kept the tools and documentation, and we moved on. And I learned a lot about computer networks in the process, so that was a plus ðŸ™ƒ.

# A Word of Caution: You Get What You Pay For

Not all outsourcing is created equal.

We've all seen the difference between a professional product team and a low-cost dev shop. The latter often looks appealing upfront, but quickly becomes a source of frustration: no real ownership, poor communication, and endless requests for clarification. Progress slows as every decision requires another handoff.

Worse still, some teams operate like mercenaries, charging extra for every small change, every update, every conversation that goes five minutes longer than scoped. They treat projects as transactions, not partnerships. What starts as a cost-saving move ends up costing more in time, stress, and technical debt.

Personally, I feel this is one of the reasons people are often so skeptical about hiring a development firm to outsource. If you have ever worked with cheap freelancers, you know what I'm talking about. It's hard to integrate them on your team; they don't follow instructions or defined rituals, and you may end up having to fix things yourself.

Successful outsourcing only happens when both sides share accountability for outcomes. That means open communication, aligned goals, and mutual respect.
