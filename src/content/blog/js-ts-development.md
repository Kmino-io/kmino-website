# An Opinionated Approach to JavaScript & TypeScript Development

Welcome to Kmino â€” this time we talk code ðŸ¤“!

To share a bit of our internal culture and the way we approach software, we decided to pick a slightly polemic topic: **OOP vs Functional Programming**. Along the way, weâ€™ll also touch on how to use **IntelliSense** in your favor, and why good typing matters so much for developers consuming your SDKs or working inside your codebase.

ðŸ’¡ Spoiler #1: never type objects as `any` â€” itâ€™s 2025, we can do better.  
ðŸ’¡ Spoiler #2: if you can, always go TypeScript. If not, at least use **JSDoc + a solid linter pipeline**.

Weâ€™ve worked with multiple languages and frameworks, but since JS/TS dominates most modern stacks, thatâ€™s where weâ€™ll focus here.

And for those of you in a hurry, hereâ€™s the TL;DR of whatâ€™s ahead:

1. **JS/TS offers multiple ways to structure code.**
2. **Weâ€™ve seen both functional-first and OOP-first codebases at scale.**
3. **A disciplined OOP approach creates APIs and SDKs that last â€” less refactor pain, easier onboarding, fewer bugs.**
