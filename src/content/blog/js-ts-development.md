# An Opinionated Approach to JavaScript & TypeScript Development

Welcome to Kmino: this time we talk code ü§ì!

To share a bit of our internal culture and the way we approach software, we decided to pick a slightly polemic topic: **OOP vs Functional Programming**. Along the way, we‚Äôll also touch on how to use **IntelliSense** in your favor, and why good typing matters so much for developers consuming your SDKs or working inside your codebase.

- Spoiler #1: never type objects as `any`. It‚Äôs 2025, we can do better.  
- Spoiler #2: if you can, always go TypeScript. If not, at least use **JSDoc + a solid linter pipeline**.

We‚Äôve worked with multiple languages and frameworks, but since JS/TS dominates most modern stacks, that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll focus here.

And for those of you in a hurry, here‚Äôs the TL;DR of what‚Äôs ahead:

1. **JS/TS offers multiple ways to structure code.**
2. **We‚Äôve seen both functional-first and OOP-first codebases at scale.**
3. **A disciplined OOP approach creates APIs and SDKs that last. You'll have less refactor pain, easier onboarding, fewer bugs.**

## OOP vs Functional in JS/TS

I won‚Äôt go as far as saying the React team openly regrets the shift to functional components, but even React veterans admit the move brought some baggage. Hooks solved real problems, but they also introduced new ones: **memory leaks, stale closures, harder-to-read lifecycles, and business logic that‚Äôs less intuitive at first glance**.

A good example is a post titled [_7 Reasons to Outlaw React‚Äôs Functional Components_](https://medium.com/%40housecor/7-reasons-to-outlaw-reacts-functional-components-ff5b5ae09b7c), which argues that class components remain simpler and more predictable, especially for stateful logic and lifecycle control.

Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love functional programming. Pure functions, static utilities, helpers you can reuse everywhere? Great. But when you‚Äôre building something complex‚ÄîSDKs, APIs, or apps with a lot of moving parts‚Äî**OOP shines**. With encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and protected/private members, you keep logic clean, business concepts clear, and onboarding easier for new devs.

At Kmino, we‚Äôve seen this play out in real projects. Take [Pali Wallet](https://paliwallet.com), one of our oldest products. Our first attempt leaned hard into React‚Äôs functional style. The result? Buggy code, constant state issues, and several user complaints a week. After refactoring to class-based modules the `EVMManager`, `UTXOManager`, and so on‚Äîbugs dropped dramatically. Complaints went from weekly emails to one every few months. Encapsulation and clear business logic gave developers a map instead of a maze.

So, here‚Äôs our stance:

- Use **functional** for pure logic, stateless helpers, and utilities.
- Use **OOP** for long-lived, complex business logic where clarity and structure matter most.

In future posts we‚Äôll dig deeper into things like `extends` vs `implements`, protected vs private, and how to mix OOP and functional styles when it actually makes sense.

Until then, if this resonated, drop us a line at our [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kminotech/) with what you‚Äôd like us to cover next.

### A Visual Note on Lifecycles

Here‚Äôs a simple diagram contrasting the ‚Äúclean‚Äù lifecycle flow of a class component with the more complex tangle of multiple hooks in a functional setup:

## JSDoc & TypeScript: Scaling APIs & SDKs

So we can forget to talk about the typing system which can really empower your class usage. At Kmino, we believe that **syntax sugar and IntelliSense aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúnice-to-haves.‚Äù** They create a **navigation system** you can trust making your methods, classes, and objects easier to reuse with purpose, and reducing the need to repeatedly check docs or guess what things do.

Think of it this way: in the complex world of databases, a simple piece of metadata like an index can transform performance. Similarly, **TypeScript and JSDoc function as metadata for your code**. They don‚Äôt change runtime behavior, but they significantly enhance how you, your automation, and even AI tools understand, navigate, and build robust systems.

### Practical Benefits

- **Autocomplete:** Write code faster and more accurately.
- **Inline docs:** Your IDE becomes the documentation.
- **SDK usability:** Your users don‚Äôt guess, they get guardrails and clarity.

### Generics & Templates in Action

With **generics**, you create abstractions that are both reusable and type-safe:

```ts
class Dog<TBreed> {
  constructor(public breed: TBreed) {}

  bark(): void {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
  eat(food: string): void {
    console.log(`${this.breed} eats ${food}`);
  }
}

// Usage
const yorkie = new Dog<"Yorkshire">("Yorkshire");
const rottweiler = new Dog<"Rottweiler">("Rottweiler");
```

Each instance shares behavior (`bark`, `eat`) but carries breed-specific data like `furType`, `diseases`, or `energyLevel`, all handled safely thanks to typing.

### Real-World Impact

We‚Äôve used these patterns in production SDKs and APIs, yielding:

- Cleaner code
- Easier onboarding
- Fewer refactors
- A more cost-effective future for our customers

In short: **clear typing = happy future developers.**

## Closing Thoughts

That‚Äôs all for today, folks! We hope this gave you a glimpse into how we think and build at Kmino, from the paradigms of **OOP vs FP (Functional Programming)** to the ‚Äúlittle extras‚Äù like **JSDoc and TypeScript** that turn code into a more reliable, business-aligned system.

Our main takeaway is simple: **both paradigms have value**, but when dealing with real-world complexity we tend to stick with classes. Even if they add a bit of overhead or feel less reusable at the method level, the payoff in lifecycle clarity, memory management, abstraction, and alignment with business logic is worth it every single time.

And remember: You can supercharge those foundations with metadata like **JSDoc or TypeScript**, which improve navigation, usability, and developer happiness. We didn‚Äôt even dive into **TDD/BDD methodologies**, but that‚Äôs a rabbit hole we‚Äôll leave for another day. 

If you‚Äôre still hungry for more, here‚Äôs a teaser: **we‚Äôre cooking a new open-source repo for blockchain data indexing.** This has been battle-tested in an NFT marketplace project, and we‚Äôll share how these concepts helped us design a fast, robust, and elegant codebase. Outperforming general-purpose indexers and subgraph solutions. Stay tuned for that post!

Thanks for reading this far and see you next week! üöÄ
