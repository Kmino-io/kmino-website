# An Opinionated Approach to JavaScript & TypeScript Development

Welcome to Kmino ‚Äî this time we talk code ü§ì!

To share a bit of our internal culture and the way we approach software, we decided to pick a slightly polemic topic: **OOP vs Functional Programming**. Along the way, we‚Äôll also touch on how to use **IntelliSense** in your favor, and why good typing matters so much for developers consuming your SDKs or working inside your codebase.

üí° Spoiler #1: never type objects as `any` ‚Äî it‚Äôs 2025, we can do better.  
üí° Spoiler #2: if you can, always go TypeScript. If not, at least use **JSDoc + a solid linter pipeline**.

We‚Äôve worked with multiple languages and frameworks, but since JS/TS dominates most modern stacks, that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll focus here.

And for those of you in a hurry, here‚Äôs the TL;DR of what‚Äôs ahead:

1. **JS/TS offers multiple ways to structure code.**
2. **We‚Äôve seen both functional-first and OOP-first codebases at scale.**
3. **A disciplined OOP approach creates APIs and SDKs that last ‚Äî less refactor pain, easier onboarding, fewer bugs.**

## OOP vs Functional in JS/TS

I won‚Äôt go as far as saying the React team openly regrets the shift to functional components‚Äîbut even React veterans admit the move brought some baggage. Hooks solved real problems, but they also introduced new ones: **memory leaks, stale closures, harder-to-read lifecycles, and business logic that‚Äôs less intuitive at first glance**.

A good example is a post titled [_7 Reasons to Outlaw React‚Äôs Functional Components_](https://medium.com/%40housecor/7-reasons-to-outlaw-reacts-functional-components-ff5b5ae09b7c), which argues that class components remain simpler and more predictable, especially for stateful logic and lifecycle control.

Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI love functional programming. Pure functions, static utilities, helpers you can reuse everywhere? Great. But when you‚Äôre building something complex‚ÄîSDKs, APIs, or apps with a lot of moving parts‚Äî**OOP shines**. With encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and protected/private members, you keep logic clean, business concepts clear, and onboarding easier for new devs.

At Kmino, we‚Äôve seen this play out in real projects. Take [Pali Wallet](https://paliwallet.com), one of our oldest products. Our first attempt leaned hard into React‚Äôs functional style. The result? Buggy code, constant state issues, and 10+ user complaints a week. After refactoring to class-based modules‚Äî`EVMManager`, `UTXOManager`, and so on‚Äîbugs dropped dramatically. Complaints went from weekly emails to one every few months. Encapsulation and clear business logic gave developers a map instead of a maze.

So, here‚Äôs our stance:

- Use **functional** for pure logic, stateless helpers, and utilities.
- Use **OOP** for long-lived, complex business logic where clarity and structure matter most.

In future posts we‚Äôll dig deeper into things like `extends` vs `implements`, protected vs private, and how to mix OOP and functional styles when it actually makes sense.

Until then, if this resonated, drop us a line at **read@kmino.io** with what you‚Äôd like us to cover next.

### A Visual Note on Lifecycles

Here‚Äôs a simple diagram contrasting the ‚Äúclean‚Äù lifecycle flow of a class component with the more complex tangle of multiple hooks in a functional setup:
