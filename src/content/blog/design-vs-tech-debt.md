# Design Debt vs Tech Debt: How to Diagnose, Prioritize, and Pay Down Both

Most teams talk about “tech debt,” but just as often it’s design debt that blocks adoption and slows delivery. One hurts your users (confusing flows, inconsistent UI); the other hurts your developers (fragile code, risky changes). In reality, they compound each other. 

Today I'll talk about a pragmatic structure from our MVP scoping method and adding "AI‑aware" estimation to make visible progress in weeks, not quarters.

## Definitions (so we fix the right thing)

- **Design Debt**: Gaps in UX, content, and visual consistency that increase user effort and support load. **Symptoms**: unclear affordances, divergent component styles, redundant flows, naming chaos, inaccessible patterns.
- **Technical Debt**: Code, architecture, and infra shortcuts that raise change risk and slow delivery. **Symptoms**: missing tests, tangled dependencies, no seams for change, copy pasted logic, noisy logs, flaky pipelines.

Both accrue “interest.” Design debt increases drop‑offs and support time. Tech debt increases cycle time and defect rates. The trick is to treat them as one portfolio with different payoff vectors.

## A simple diagnostic you can run in 90 minutes

Run this with a PM, a designer, and an engineer. Cap findings to one line each.

1) Pick 3 core journeys (signup → value; repeat use; admin/ops).  
2) For each journey, capture:
   - Design debt symptoms (confusion, rework, inconsistency)
   - Tech debt symptoms (risk hotspots, slow builds, missing tests)
3) Tag each item:
   - **User Pain**: low/medium/high
   - **Change Risk**: low/medium/high
   - **AI Impact Potential**: high/medium/low (how much AI can accelerate this paydown)

That’s your first debt inventory.

### Example (pulling it together)

- From sign up to browsing items, the user goes through 7 steps. This is confusing and likely reduces conversion.  
- User Pain: Medium  
- Change Risk: High  
- AI Impact Potential: Low

## Quantify the cost (use "AI‑aware" estimation)

From our [AI‑era estimation approach](https://www.kmino.io/blog/software-estimation-with-ai), estimate each item three ways:

- **AO (AI‑Optimistic)**: best case with strong AI help
- **AR (AI‑Realistic)**: typical cycle with prompt refinement + review
- **TR (Traditional/Realistic)**: manual fallback

Use: \((AO + 2×AR + TR) / 4\) for a balanced estimate.  
Then add two outcome metrics:

- **User Impact** (design debt): conversion lift, task time reduction
- **Delivery Impact** (tech debt): cycle time reduction, flake rate drop, defect rate drop

Prioritize by “impact per week.”

## Portfolio view: one 2×2 for both debts

- X‑axis: **User Pain** (low → high)  
- Y‑axis: **Change Risk** (low → high)

Tackle in this order:

1) High Pain, Low Risk → quick wins (often design debt, copy/IA fixes, UI consistency)  
2) High Pain, High Risk → split with seams, flags, and tests; schedule a focused sprint  
3) Low Pain, Low Risk → opportunistic tidy‑ups when adjacent work happens  
4) Low Pain, High Risk → defer or redesign upstream to avoid touching

### Example (applying the 2×2)

|               | Change Risk: Low | Change Risk: High |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **User Pain: Low**  | **Profile spacing off** — fix in next UI pass. | **Analytics DB migration** — defer; use exports until it fits roadmap. |
| **User Pain: High** | **Mobile “reorder” missing** — add visible home button; ship this sprint. | **Checkout discounts hardcoded** — centralize in pricing service behind a flag; schedule a focused sprint. |

## A 2–3 week debt paydown sprint (time‑boxed)

Borrowing the structure from our MVP worksheet, here’s a template:

### 1) One‑line objective

For **target users/devs**, reduce **friction/risk** in **journey/module** so that **measurable outcome**.

### 2) Scope the happy path (≤7 steps)

Map the exact flow you’ll improve. If it’s >7 steps, you’re **over‑scoping**.

### 3) MoSCoW the backlog

- Must: essential UX fixes and enabling seams/tests
- Should: small polish or low‑risk refactors
- Could: backlog for v1.1
- Won’t: explicitly out of scope

### 4) Acceptance criteria

Use Given/When/Then for one happy path and two edge cases across UX and code.

### 5) Success metrics

- Design: task time ↓, error rate ↓, conversion ↑, support tickets ↓
- Tech: lead time ↓, flaky tests ↓, MTTR ↓, change failure rate ↓

### 6) Constraints & guardrails

Budget, accessibility level, performance budgets, security basics, observability requirements.

### 7) Risks and cheapest tests

- Prototype risky UX in Figma first
- Spike refactors behind feature flags
- Contract tests on critical integrations

## Playbooks: what to fix first

**Design debt:** make screens consistent, fix labels and navigation, improve readability and keyboard access, and tighten copy.  

**Tech debt:** separate parts so changes are safer, add tests on key flows, add logs and a simple health dashboard, and ship database changes in small steps.

## Using AI (safely)

Use AI to draft the list of issues, rough estimates, and release notes. Keep people in charge of scope and approvals. Don’t let AI change architecture or add scope without review.

## Examples (small set, big impact)

- Confusing pricing toggle  
  - One‑line objective: Increase plan selection on pricing page.  
  - Acceptance criteria: Given a visitor on pricing, when they toggle monthly/annual, then the selected plan remains clear and copy shows savings; plan selection rate improves by ≥5% in two weeks.  
  
- Flaky webhook retries  
  - One‑line objective: Cut incidents from failed webhooks.  
  - Acceptance criteria: Given a temporary provider error, when a webhook fails, then it auto‑retries with backoff and alerts the team; incident pages drop by ≥50% month‑over‑month.  

- Inconsistent empty states  
  - One‑line objective: Reduce support pings from confusing empty screens.  
  - Acceptance criteria: Given a first‑time user with no data, when they open the dashboard, then they see a clear next step (CTA) and help link; “can’t find data” tickets drop by ≥20% in the first week.  

Pick the top three, spend 2–3 weeks, and report results.

## Keep it small, always

- Bi-Weekly: 30‑minute review, pick 1–2 quick wins.  
- Planning: reserve 10–20% capacity for debt.  
- Done means: docs, tests, and monitoring updated.  
- Quarterly: stop doing what creates new debt; double‑down on what worked.

## Closing Thoughts

Design debt hurts users. Tech debt slows delivery. Track both in one list, fix the highest pain with lowest risk first, and work in short, focused sprints. You’ll see fewer support tickets and faster releases.

**tl;dr:**

- Keep one debt list.  
- Time‑box to 2–3 weeks.  
- Use AI for drafts, not decisions.  
- Fix high‑pain, low‑risk items first.  
- Lock in wins with tests and monitoring.
